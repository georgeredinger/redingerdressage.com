Duplicate, clone, backup and transfer an entire site from one location to another in 3 easy steps.


== Description ==

The Duplicator plugin is designed to give Wordpress Administrators the ability to migrate a site from one location to another location in 3 easy steps.  Just create a package, download it and install.  No need to change all your settings and re-run import/export scripts. The plugin also serves as a simple backup utility. 

If you need to clone, duplicate or template a WordPress application, then this plugin is ideal for multiple site generation.  Niche site generation is a breeze with the Duplicator and moving your WordPress site has never been easier.  Stay tuned for other cool features to help automate your Wordpress management.

DEVELOPERS: This tool is great for pulling a production site down onto your local machine for testing and validation. It also works great for developing locally and then pushing up to a production server.

DISCLAIMER: This plugin has been heavily tested, however it does require above average technical knowledge.  Please use it at your own risk and do not forget to back up your files beforehand.

NOTE: This project is currently in Beta, the underlying logic to perform all these migration tasks is quite involved. It's impossible to know how each system is setup, this is why your feedback is very important to us.  Thanks for helping us to make WordPress the best blogging platform in the world.
